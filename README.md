# power-bi-sales-performance
For this project, I created a sales performance dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides an overview of store sales and product ordering details.

Using data from the store's sales database, I created a dashboard that displays the store's sales performance in the form of key performance indicators (KPIs) and charts. The KPIs include total sales revenue, total number of orders, and average order value.

The dashboard also includes a visualization that shows the top-selling products and a map that displays the locations of the store's customers. Additionally, there is a detailed view of each order that shows the product, quantity, and price.

The dashboard is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, allowing users to filter data by date range, product category, and location. It also features a search bar that enables users to quickly find specific products or customers.

Overall, this project showcases my ability to use Power BI to create visually appealing and informative dashboards that provide valuable insights into sales performance.
